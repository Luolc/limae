# Release guard: only a commit whose CI on main is green, at the first
# attempt, is released. CI is not run again here: a fresh run can pass where
# main's run failed, and a rerun can turn a flaky red into green, so neither
# counts.
# Usage: release_ci_green.sh COMMIT [OWNER/REPO]   (default $GITHUB_REPOSITORY)
# Reads the latest ci.yml run that a push of COMMIT to main started. Waits
# while it has not completed, every RELEASE_CI_INTERVAL seconds (default 30)
# for at most RELEASE_CI_TIMEOUT seconds (default 1800).
# Exit 0 when the run completed with success at run_attempt 1; 1 when there
# is no such run, it disappears or does not complete in time, or it ended
# otherwise or at a later attempt; 4 when the runs cannot be read.
